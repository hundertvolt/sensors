# Sensor Framework

A generic asyncio-based sensor framework for **Raspberry Pi Pico W (1st gen, RP2040)** boards
running **MicroPython**, currently applied to room air-quality monitoring. Each physical unit
reads sensors over I2C/SPI, exposes a REST API plus a small web UI, persists frequently-changing
data to an external FRAM chip, and persists configuration to a JSON file on the onboard flash
filesystem. Code ships as frozen bytecode compiled into the MicroPython firmware, not loaded from
the device filesystem at runtime.

**5 units are currently deployed**: `arzi`, `wozi`, and three physically-identical-to-arzi units
sharing the `neu` build (same sensors, different GPIO wiring). `dev` is a bench/test rig only.

| Config | Sensors | FRAM | Watchdog | HTML source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| arzi | SCD30 (CO2/temp/hum), SGP40 (VOC) | yes | active (8000ms) | `html_raw/arzi` |
| neu ×3 | same as arzi, different pin assignments | yes | active | `html_raw/arzi` (reused) |
| wozi | SCD30, SGP40, BMP388 (pressure/temp) | yes | active | `html_raw/wozi` |
| dev | SCD30, SGP40, SHTC3, MPRLS, ISL29125 | no | disabled | `html_raw/dev` (bench rig) |

## Architecture at a glance

- **Sensor Reader/Driver split** — every `IndividualDrivers/asy_<chip>_driver.py` has a low-level
  chip driver (register-level I2C/SPI calls, several adapted from Adafruit CircuitPython
  libraries) plus a `*_Reader` wrapper providing the common async-task surface
  (`start_asy_read()`/`start_asy_trigger()`/`start_timer()`, a lock-protected `DataManager`, an
  error counter, and config callbacks). New sensors are expected to follow this shape.
- **Bus layer** — `asy_i2c_driver.py`/`asy_spi_driver.py` wrap `machine.I2C`/`machine.SPI` with an
  `asyncio.Lock` and a CircuitPython-style `async with device as dev:` pattern so multiple sensors
  can share one physical bus.
- **Config management** (`async_manager.ConfigManager`) — flat JSON file on the flash filesystem.
  Self-heals on corruption/missing keys by overwriting the *entire* file with hardcoded defaults —
  see BACKLOG.md, this is a known data-loss risk on firmware upgrades that add config keys.
- **REST API pipeline** (`api_helpers.py`) — every `PUT` handler follows `cmd_pre_check` →
  `init_json_from_cfg` → `update_valid_json` → `set_sensor_value` → `cmd_post_check` (validate →
  load current → per-field validate → apply to sensor → persist + post-hooks).
- **FRAM storage** (`asy_fram_driver.py`/`asy_fram_manager.py`, arzi/neu/wozi only) — a bump
  allocator handing out chunks stored as two redundant copies, so an abrupt power-loss or watchdog
  reset mid-write still leaves one valid copy to recover. Currently used for SGP40's VOC
  baseline/humidity-compensation backup.
- **Networking** (`async_connect.py`) — STA-mode WiFi with captive-portal AP+hotspot fallback,
  NTP client with hardcoded CET/CEST DST math.
- **Task supervisor** (`main()` in every `sensortask-*.py`) — two-tier self-healing: dead tasks are
  silently restarted (decaying error score); if the error score exceeds a threshold, the loop stops
  feeding the hardware watchdog and lets it force a hard reset. Units are meant to run for years
  unattended.
- **Frontend** — hand-written HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no build tooling. At build time the per-device
  folder + `general/` are gzipped and packed into a `frozen_html.py` module via `freezefs`, served
  through Microdot's `send_file(..., compressed=True)`.

## Build process

### Toolchain setup (`toolchain/setup_toolchain.py`)

Building firmware needs a matching set of MicroPython + `pico-sdk` + `picotool` + the ARM
cross-compiler. Getting these four to actually agree with each other used to be a manual,
error-prone recipe (`update_and_install.txt`); it's now one scripted, updatable command. Full
design details live in `toolchain/README.md` — this section is the everyday-usage cheat sheet.

**Bumping the MicroPython version**: change `toolchain/versions.toml`'s `[micropython] ref`
(by hand, or via `setup_toolchain.py --latest` — see "Updating" below). That's the *only* place
to change it — everything else derives from that one value automatically, with no second file to
keep in sync:

- The matching `pico-sdk`/`picotool` versions (see "How it works" in `toolchain/README.md`).
- The MicroPython type stubs `scripts/typecheck.sh` uses for `mypy` (see "Code quality tooling"
  below) — it reads this same `ref` and installs the matching stub release, failing with a clear
  error instead of silently drifting if no matching stub release exists upstream yet.
- The Unix port build (`ports/unix`, used for running tests under the real interpreter later) —
  it's built from the same MicroPython clone `setup_toolchain.py` already checks out at this
  `ref`, not a separately-versioned artifact.

Every build step runs in an explicitly constructed environment (fixed `PATH`, a small
variable allowlist), not whatever happens to be ambient in your shell — a stray `CC`/`CFLAGS`,
a shadowing binary earlier in `PATH`, or a leftover `PICO_SDK_PATH` from an unrelated project
can't silently change what gets built. Verified adversarially against a deliberately poisoned
environment (fake compilers/tools placed ahead in `PATH`, garbage build-flag env vars) — see
"Environment isolation" in `toolchain/README.md`.

**Prerequisites** (a stock Ubuntu 24.04 install already satisfies all of these):

- A Debian/Ubuntu system with the `universe` component enabled in apt sources (on by default for
  every official Ubuntu image/ISO — only relevant if you're on a deliberately minimal base, e.g. a
  `debootstrap`-built rootfs, which only enables `main` unless told otherwise). `gcc-arm-none-eabi`
  and friends live in `universe`.
- `sudo` access (the script uses it for `apt-get install` and `picotool`'s `make install`).
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) itself installed — `pip install uv`, or the official installer
  `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (the script's own dependencies are then handled
  automatically by `uv run`, no separate `pip install`/venv step needed for anything else).
- Outbound network access to GitHub and your distro's package mirrors.

**Verified from scratch on a genuinely clean Ubuntu 24.04 system** (a `debootstrap`-built `noble`
chroot with nothing preinstalled beyond the minimal base — no apt cache, no build tools, no `uv`):
installs every dependency itself and passes verification. (That specific clean-chroot run predates
the 8-step chain below and covered the simpler design it replaced — see `toolchain/README.md`'s
"Evidence this actually works" for exactly what's been re-verified since, and CLAUDE.md's "Pre-push
verification" for when a fresh clean-chroot pass is required again.)

**Everyday usage:**

```sh
# First-time setup (also the command you re-run for everyday use — see "Updating" below)
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py

# Build a specific MicroPython version instead of the pinned default
# (e.g. matching the version actually deployed on units today, see CLAUDE.md)
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py --micropython-ref v1.26.1

# Install somewhere other than the default ~/pico-toolchain
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py --toolchain-dir /path/to/toolchain
```

**Updating** an existing install is the same command, not a separate procedure:

```sh
# Detect + pin + install the newest stable MicroPython release
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py --latest

# Or bump toolchain/versions.toml's [micropython] ref by hand, then:
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py
```

Either way, the matching `pico-sdk`/`picotool` versions are re-derived automatically and only
what's actually changed gets rebuilt — including, deliberately, not rebuilding `mpy-cross` at
all if its source hasn't changed since last time (see below for when you don't want that).

**Forcing a truly from-scratch rebuild** without re-cloning the (multi-gigabyte) git sources:

```sh
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py --clean
```

Normal `setup`/update runs are intentionally incremental where it's safe to be: the firmware and
Unix-port builds always fully recompile (so "builds with zero errors/warnings" stays a genuine
proof every run), but `mpy-cross`'s build directory is otherwise left alone and just rebuilds
whatever actually changed. `--clean` wipes every build-artifact directory (`picotool/build`,
`mpy-cross/build`, `ports/rp2/build-<board>`, `ports/unix/build-standard`) before building,
bringing the toolchain back to a from-scratch build state on demand — useful if you suspect a
stale build artifact, or just want to confirm a truly clean build still succeeds.

**Testing** an already-installed toolchain (no `setup`/network/apt work, just a fast rebuild +
re-check — ~30s vs. minutes for `setup`):

```sh
uv run toolchain/setup_toolchain.py test
```

`setup` provisions the toolchain once, `test` is the repeatable, offline gate that checks it
still builds cleanly. `scripts/test.sh` (see "Code quality tooling" below) relies on this
directly: it runs `setup` automatically the first time it needs the Unix-port interpreter, then
reuses the cached build on later runs — including in CI, via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**What a successful `setup` or `test` run proves**, every time — an 8-step frozen-bytecode
verification chain (`run_verification_sequence()`), each step gating the next:

1. Write a small test module.
2. Build `mpy-cross` (the cross-compiler).
3. Cross-compile the test module with `mpy-cross` directly.
4. Build the MicroPython Unix port with the test module frozen in — zero compiler errors/warnings.
5. Import the frozen module *by name* inside that Unix port binary (no source `.py` file anywhere
   on disk) and check its result — proves `mpy-cross` and the Unix port build both actually work.
   This is the host-side interpreter used for running tests later, see "Code quality tooling"
   below and `tests/README.md`'s "Why not pytest".
6. Build the RP2 firmware for the target board with the same test module frozen in — zero
   errors/warnings (build-only; there's no RP2 hardware here to run it on).
7. Clean up the frozen-bytecode build artifacts from steps 4–6.
8. Rebuild a vanilla (non-frozen) Unix port — the standing test rig `scripts/test.sh` runs tests
   under.

"Evidence this actually works".

### Building this project's firmware

Each `build-<device>.sh`: assembles `python/build/` from `CommonDrivers` + the manifest + the
device's needed `IndividualDrivers` + gzipped/frozen HTML → temporarily swaps `modules/_boot.py`
and `modules/sensortask-<device>.py` (renamed to `sensortask.py`) into the upstream MicroPython
`ports/rp2/modules/` directory → runs
`make -C ports/rp2 BOARD=RPI_PICO_W FROZEN_MANIFEST=<path>` → copies out `firmware.uf2` → restores
the original `_boot.py`.

This still assumes the repo's `python/` directory is checked out as `py-include/python` alongside
the `micropython` tree that `toolchain/setup_toolchain.py` sets up, with `FROZEN_MANIFEST`'s
hardcoded `/home/nico/rpi_pico/...` path in each `build-<device>.sh` genericized to match — not yet
done, see BACKLOG.md.

## Refactor in progress

The `improved-quality/` refactor (see "Repository layout" above) isn't just a cleanup — it targets
the most recent *stable* MicroPython/pico-sdk/picotool/Microdot releases, expands error handling
and bus/sensor fault recovery considerably beyond what's described above, and adds unit tests,
mypy, ruff, and a CI pipeline (including a real firmware build, eventually — the current pipeline
covers lint/type-check/unit-tests only) that don't exist for the current codebase at all. Files
move to `src/` once fully reviewed and tested against that bar — see `src/` and `tests/` in
"Repository layout" above. See BACKLOG.md's "Refactor targets not yet done" for what's still open.

## Code quality tooling

Ruff and mypy checks, scoped to `improved-quality/`, `src/`, and `tests/` (the pre-refactor
codebase — `python/`, `modules/` — isn't covered yet), plus unit tests for `src/`, can be run
manually. Needs Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`, stdlib only since 3.11 — `uv sync` enforces this
automatically via `pyproject.toml`'s `requires-python`, so this only matters if `uv` has to fall
back to whatever `python3` it finds):

```sh
uv sync                    # one-time, and after pulling changes - installs ruff/mypy/pytest into .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # scripts/lint.sh and scripts/typecheck.sh assume ruff/mypy are already on PATH

scripts/lint.sh            # ruff check
scripts/typecheck.sh       # mypy, using MicroPython stubs matching toolchain/versions.toml (see above)
scripts/test.sh            # runs every test in tests/, under a real MicroPython Unix-port interpreter -
                            # builds that interpreter automatically on first run (see tests/README.md)
scripts/test.sh --coverage # same, plus a src/-only line coverage report (HTML/XML/markdown) - see below
```

All three (`lint.sh`/`typecheck.sh`/`test.sh`) run in GitHub Actions CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push/PR, plus `test.sh --coverage` as a non-gating extra
step. Config lives in the root `pyproject.toml`; see CLAUDE.md's "Code quality tooling" section
for the full rationale (why `ruff format` isn't used, why the MicroPython stubs install into a
separate `typings/` directory instead of the main dev venv, why tests don't run under
pytest/CPython, etc.).

### Test coverage

```sh
scripts/test.sh --coverage
```

Reports line coverage of `src/` only, from the same `tests/test_*.py` suite `scripts/test.sh`
already runs — no coverage threshold is enforced, this only reports numbers, it never fails the
build over them. Since `coverage.py` itself only runs under CPython while `src/` only ever runs
under the real MicroPython Unix-port interpreter, collection and reporting are two separate
stages (`tests/_coverage_runner.py` inside MicroPython, `scripts/_render_coverage.py` under
CPython via `uv run`) glued together through `coverage.py`'s own `CoverageData` API — see
`tests/README.md`'s "Coverage" section for the full pipeline. Uses the same Unix port binary as
plain `scripts/test.sh` (it's always built with `MICROPY_PY_SYS_SETTRACE=1`, a negligible,
behavior-neutral cost when unused — see `build_unix_port()` — so there's no second interpreter to
build or cache); the RP2040 firmware build never gets this flag.

Produces, at the repo root (all gitignored, regenerated every run):

- `htmlcov/index.html` — browsable line-by-line HTML report.
- `coverage.xml` — Cobertura XML.
- `coverage_summary.md` — a markdown table.

**Locally, `scripts/test.sh --coverage` does not open anything automatically** — it only prints
the three paths above; open `htmlcov/index.html` yourself (e.g. `xdg-open htmlcov/index.html` on
Linux, `open htmlcov/index.html` on macOS) to browse the HTML report.

**On GitHub, there is no visualization on the repo's main page** — no README badge, no GitHub
Pages. What CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) actually does with each of the three files, all as
non-gating, `continue-on-error: true` steps:

- `coverage_summary.md` is appended to that workflow run's **Job Summary** — click into the
  specific run under the repo's Actions tab, the table is at the bottom of that run's page. This
  needs no external service and always works.
- `htmlcov/` is uploaded as a **downloadable build artifact** on that same run's page — GitHub
  doesn't render it inline; download the zip and open `index.html` locally to browse it.
- `coverage.xml` is uploaded to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) (free for public repos), which
  can add PR comments/checks and its own hosted dashboard — but only once this repo is registered
  at [codecov.io](https://about.codecov.io/) and either a `CODECOV_TOKEN` repo secret or Codecov's
  OIDC/tokenless support is set up; that account-linking step hasn't been done yet, so today this
  step just runs and silently produces nothing visible.
